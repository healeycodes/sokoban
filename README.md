A Sokoban game built with Next.js â€” skinned with [Boxxle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxxle) sprites, and packaged with 40 tiny eloquent levels from the [Microcosmos level collection](http://sneezingtiger.com/sokoban/levels/minicosmosText.html).

Also included is a breadth-first search [solver](https://github.com/healeycodes/sokoban/blob/main/game/solver.ts) with a transposition table and move-ordering.
